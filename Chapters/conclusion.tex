\section{FPGA File Port}\label{sec:FPGAChange}
Currently the FPGA Hardware design is where all the data is being received from the RF Front end and processed. This is a pre compiled bit file delivered by NI to work with their version of the LTE AFW Software. To adapt the design to suit the needs of the current research, the FPGA bit file has to be ported to suit our design
