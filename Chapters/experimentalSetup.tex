Chapter \ref{ch:PotenHWSetup} discussed the possible options to implement a MIMO setup. The first option (section \ref{sec:USRP}) was not viable due to technical limitations as it is described in \ref{sec:USRPSync}.

The second option (section \ref{sec:MIMOAFW}) was financially unfeasible as the additional hardware for the synchronisation was to cost over â‚¬80.000
